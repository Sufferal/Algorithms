## Introduction

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.

The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo of Pisa, an Italian mathematician who introduced the sequence to the western world in his book "Liber Abaci" published in 1202.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence has many interesting properties and appears in various areas of mathematics and science, such as biology, finance, and computer science.
