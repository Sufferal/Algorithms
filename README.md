# Analysis of algorithms
This repository contains implementations and analyses of various algorithms, including:

## Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. This sequence has various applications in mathematics, computer science, and nature.

## Sorting 
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a collection of data in a specific order. There are various sorting algorithms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some popular sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. These algorithms differ in terms of their efficiency, stability, and space complexity.

## Graph
Graph algorithms are used to analyze and manipulate graphs, which are collections of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs are widely used to represent various real-world scenarios, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks. Graph algorithms can be used to solve various problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, and detecting cycles in a graph.
